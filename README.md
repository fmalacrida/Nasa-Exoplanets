 Exoplanet Analysis and Detection Methods

This project focuses on the analysis of exoplanet datasets, exploring the relationship between discovery methods, planetary characteristics, and trends over time. The project includes both an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase and machine learning (ML) classification tasks to predict exoplanet types.

Features
 **EDA**:
Visualizations of detection methods over time.
Trends and proportions of detection methods by year of discovery.
   
**Machine Learning**:
Classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict exoplanet types based on features like mass, radius, and orbital parameters.

**Streamlit Application**:
Interactive web application for predicting exoplanet types based on user-provided inputs.
Visualizations to enhance understanding of detection methods.

## Dataset\cf3 
The dataset includes information on exoplanets, such as:
Planetary mass and radius.
Orbital characteristics.
Stellar properties.
Detection methods and discovery year.
