 Exoplanet Analysis and Detection Methods
\
This project focuses on the analysis of exoplanet datasets, exploring the relationship between discovery methods, planetary characteristics, and trends over time. The project includes both an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase and machine learning (ML) classification tasks to predict exoplanet types.\
\
\cf2 ## Features\cf3 \
\cf4 1.\cf3  **EDA**:\
\cf4    -\cf3  Visualizations of detection methods over time.\
\cf4    -\cf3  Trends and proportions of detection methods by year of discovery.\
   \
\cf4 2.\cf3  **Machine Learning**:\
\cf4    -\cf3  Classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict exoplanet types based on features like mass, radius, and orbital parameters.\
\
\cf4 3.\cf3  **Streamlit Application**:\
\cf4    -\cf3  Interactive web application for predicting exoplanet types based on user-provided inputs.\
\cf4    -\cf3  Visualizations to enhance understanding of detection methods.\
\
